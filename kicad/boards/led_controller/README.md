# Wiring

The fourth transistor is connected to GPIO2, which is high at boot.
This is intended, as the fourth transistor is usually for the white channel of a WRGB strip.
This leads to faster illumination when power is switched on (which should be default behaviour! Turn the damn lights on when the power is on!)
